## Project Workflow
Really wish I got that erd.html to work in your planning folder! That said everything looks great. Great user stories. I loved your readme, thought it was cool to have the 2 different roles seeded with example users. It'd be really nice to include some setup instructions for your application so that others can contribute to your code! Exceeds expectations.

## Technical Requirements
Your application contains 4 models far beyond the 2 that were required. I think you did a great job getting all of the models to integrate together for full CRUD functionality. I would love to give you a exceeds expectations for this bullet; however, I would like to see more complex associations. I would encourage you to look into a has_many through association between profiles and workouts. Meets expectations(though, really really nice job)

## Creativity / Interface
This app is really cool. UI is very fluid and intuitive. The aesthetics are top notch. The fact that it was handrolled makes it all the more impressive. Awesome work. Exceeds expectations.

## Code Quality
Code is properly indented. Concerns are separated. Well commented. Extra code that doesn't contribute to functionality doesn't exist. Exceeds expectations

## Deployment and Functionality
App is deployed to heroku. Full CRUD functionality on all models. Deployed version works great. You even made a custom subdomain for your heroku app! Exceeds Expectations.

## Overall
Wow!! What an amazing job Erica. You never cease to impress me. This website looks great. It's very apparent you've put alot of time and effort into this application. Very impressive.
